# hand-track-activate

Disclaimer: This is merely a beginner project that I've done to experiment with OpenCV, Mediapipe, and pynput.

A hand tracking program that activates and deactivates by the gesture of closing and opening with index and thumb finger tips. 

By measuring the distance between the two fingertips points, it activates if the distance is small enough and deactivates otherwise.

I've paired the activation with a mouse click event but it is replaceable with other functions as well.
